In this project we had to help a leading credit card provider company in identifying the right customers using predictive models. Using past data of the bankâ€™s applicants, I needed to determine the factors affecting credit risk, create strategies to mitigate the acquisition risk and assess the financial benefit of my project. In this process I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and selected the best model.
